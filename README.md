## Overview

Boxing is a sport that demands precision, timing, and skill. This AI model seeks to assist athletes and coaches by providing real-time classification of punches from images or video frames. The model classifies punches into one of the following categories:

- Jab
- Lead Hook
- Rear Hook
- Lead Uppercut
- Rear Uppercut
- Cross

By utilizing this system, users can receive feedback on the type of punch thrown, which can help improve technique and performance.

## Features

- **Multi-classification model:** Accurately classifies six different types of boxing punches.
- **Image-based analysis:** The model is designed to process image inputs (single frames or batch images).
- **Real-time identification:** Capable of providing near-instant feedback for real-time applications.
- **High accuracy:** Trained on a large dataset with diverse punch examples to ensure high classification accuracy.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a curated dataset of boxing punch images. Each image is labeled according to the punch type. The dataset includes a variety of images from different angles, lighting conditions, and fighters to ensure robustness in real-world scenarios.

### Classes:
- Jab
- Lead Hook
- Rear Hook
- Lead Uppercut
- Rear Uppercut
- Cross

The dataset can be expanded by adding more images from various sources, including training footage and fight videos.
